# Quantum Phishing Detection System

A cybersecurity solution that leverages quantum computing technologies to detect and prevent sophisticated phishing attacks. The system combines Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) for enhanced sampling techniques and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for high-accuracy classification of potential phishing threats.

Initially appeared on gist. But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push
* Python 3.8 or higher
* Qiskit 0.36.0 or higher
* Scikit-learn 1.0.2 or higher
* PennyLane 0.24.0 or higher

## Deployment

Add additional notes to deploy this on a live system

For production deployment:
1. Set up a dedicated quantum compute resource or establish an API connection to a quantum cloud provider
2. Configure environment variables for secure API access
3. Deploy as a microservice within your security infrastructure
4. Set up proper logging and monitoring systems

## Built With

* [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) - Quantum computing framework
* [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) - Quantum machine learning library
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - Web API framework
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - Classic ML integration
